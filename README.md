### Jay TODO/Notes

converting image tags to picture tags.

Loading the scaled down images based on screen resolution available!

Used derivv.com to get multiple image sizes.

Convention used:
img name -> folder name
folder has -> orginal, large, medium, small

skipping news images, cause already small.

---
fix css background img later
